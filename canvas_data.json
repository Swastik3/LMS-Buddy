To do so, please create a video that is at least three minutes long. This video must include both a video feed of yourself, audio of yourself, and some form of visual aid that helps you explain the concept. The visual aid can be anything of your choosing, with possibilities including a slide show, background video, or physical demonstration (similar to those used in lecture). If you happen to have a kid or kids in your life, your submission can be you actually teaching them the lesson, if you want, but this is not required. Please submit both your video and your background visual aid together on Canvas. You may upload the video in any commonly used format (see below for further information). Please also upload a link to or file of your slideshow, background video, or photos of your physical demonstration if you use one. If you use images, videos, or content from books or the web, please cite your sources within your uploaded material for the visual aid. How to Submit Your Lesson To upload your video, you can either upload the file directly or upload it to YouTube as an \"unlisted\" video (that means that only those who have the direct link can view it) and post that link to this assignment. If you use Google docs for your slideshow or other visual aid , when you click \"Share\", click the option to \"Change to anyone with the link\" before copying the link, otherwise the TAs and I won't be able to view it.

It is entirely up to you who you choose (with some exceptions, see \"Resources\"). While astronomy has historically not done great in the diversity department, I encourage you to pick a woman and/or person of color to lift up those voices (you can find a list of options under \"Resources\"). Please r ead all of the tabs below for instructions and resources. Overview Examples and Rubric Instructions Resources Choose an astronomer who we talked about in class, who you heard about elsewhere, from the resource guides, from the list under the \"Resources\" tab, or from any other source. Research the astronomer, focusing mainly on their journey of becoming a scientist, but also including a brief summary of the work they did/have done as a scientist (remember, the point is you're talking to kids). Please cite your sources on your visual aids. Create a 3-minute presentation aimed at the 6th-12th grade range (absolute max time is 5 minutes). We're pretending here that you're practicing your presentation for your cohort, so that you can give each other feedback and help prepare you for your presentation to the kids. Here is the grading rubric for this assignment: If you are uncomfortable sharing video of yourself, it is still possible to score highly on this assignment, but you will need to do a really good job on your visual aids. Similarly, if you don't do visual aids, it's still possible to score Explorer level. The best presentations (the ones that keep the attention of kids the most) are the ones where the audience can both see and hear you AND you have visual aids that are engaging, but don't require the audience to read much (they should be listening to you, not reading; the best slides are mostly pictures). Below are some examples for which Prof. Katie Berryhill (who designed this assignment) used Dr. Neil deGrasse Tyson, director of the Hayden Planetarium in New York City. As a result, you may NOT choose him for your presentation (see \"Resources\"). Watch the first example video to learn about him, and then just scan the others to see why they decrease in quality (and would receive lower grades). Presenter audio & video, more graphical visual aids Presenter audio only, more graphical visual aids Presenter audio and video, more textual visual aids Presenter audio and video only, no/minimal visual aids Presenter audio only, very text based visual aids Presenter audio only, no visual aids You can record your video using any software, and if you don't have a webcam I recommend utilizing the UMD One Button Studios ( https://faculty.umd.edu/1button-studios ).

If you are accessing Flipgrid, only Google Chrome or Microsoft Edge browsers on computers (not phones) will have the Share Screen option. When you're ready to record on a computer or phone with a camera, login to Flipgrid using your UMD credentials. Click the red button that says \"Record a response\". Click Options, and you'll have the option to upload a clip that you recorded elsewhere, record with mic only, mirror the video (so the video won't be flipped), share screen (so you can share slides, and you'll be able to choose a window, tab, or the entire screen), and device settings (to select the camera and mic). Click the record button, and you'll get a countdown before it starts to record. If you want to record video of yourself AND your screen, start by clicking the record button Click Options Click Record screen Click Start screen recording Select Entire screen (that's the only way it'll record both) Click Share (the video of you should pop down to the bottom right corner, and then you can bring whatever app you're using for your visual aids forward and begin your presentation) NOTE: If you're trying to record both your video and your screen, and you don't see the video of you in the bottom right corner of your screen, try this: Cancel the recording Confirm that you want to stop Start recording again, but immediately click the \"Retake\" button on the left side of the screen Click Confirm when it asks if you're sure you want to delete the clip You'll see a trash can, and it'll say \"You got this. Try again.\" Restart the process above, and it should work properly (I've tried this a bunch of times.) When you're done, return to your browser window to stop recording. You'll be able to check it over after you record and edit before you post. You can trim the beginning and end of the video, add stickers, etc. When you're ready to post, click Next. Flipgrid will prompt you to take a selfie as the thumbnail for your video. Click Next again. After it uploads, you can type in your name and title your video (use your astronomer subject's name as your title). Please place a link to your Flipgrid video in the submission window on Canvas. This page provides additional help in choosing and researching \"your\" astronomer. First, you are free to choose any astronomer, but they a) must primarily be an astronomer and not a physicist and b) must not have been thoroughly covered in class. This means that you MAY NOT CHOOSE the following scientists: Neil deGrasse Tyson (because example videos are about him) Carl Sagan (because he's just too famous) Plato Aristotle Aristarchus Eratosthenes Ptolemy Nicholas Copernicus Tycho Brahe Johannes Kepler Galileo Galilei Isaac Newton (primarily physicist) Albert Einstein (primarily physicist) Stephen Hawking (primarily physicist) If you are unsure whether the scientist you have chosen would qualify, please confirm with your TA. If you would like to make your presentation about a non-white-dude astronomer, the following (incomplete) list might be a good starting point: Aaron S.

You will construct a hypothetical argument that differs from the argument you wish to make in your Position Paper. This hypothetical argument need not be the opposite; it just has to be different. The purpose of this exercise is to get you thinking about how a reasonable person might arrive at a position that you disagree with (or think is less compelling than your own). You will do so by: composing a clear, specific, and positively worded claim/thesis for a position on your topic that is different from the position you will argue in the Position Paper. composing a partition, or road map, that lays out three reasons for this other position that you would (hypothetically) use to justify this position. This can either be a part of the thesis or a separate sentence. For each reason, give a brief justification. Here\u2019s some tips for completing this exercise. 1. Stating your \u2018other side\u2019 claim in a positive way To complete the first part of this exercise, you want to state a position different than your own position\u2014not necessarily the opposite\u2014in a positive way. Instead of arguing against your own position, you want to argue in favor of the other proposition that you are advancing as if it were your own. To do this, you will want to avoid simply negating your (real) Position Paper\u2019s thesis. For example, if your actual position is: The University of Maryland should block student users from access to social media such as Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok. Avoid merely turning your positively stated position into a negative one: The University of Maryland should not block student users from access to Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok. Instead, you want to formulate a positive argument for a different position: The University of Maryland should protect students\u2019 rights to free expression and allow them to continue using social media such as Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok. Note that it\u2019s possible that you may have to restate the argument and/or change stases in order to make a positive argument. 2. Partition Once you have a thesis, you want to make a partition, or road map, that gives three reasons for this position. This can be part of thesis (e.g., I argue X for reasons A, B, and C.) or a separate sentence (I argue X. I will do so by arguing A, B, and C.) You don\u2019t have to believe these reasons personally\u2014this is a hypothetical situation to help you understand why someone else might think this way\u2014but you also don\u2019t necessarily have to make claims you feel totally uncomfortable making (remember: it doesn't have to be the opposite opinion, just a different opinion). You also don't want the reasons to be clich\u00e9s or stereotypes. Think about what a reasonable person who actually holds this position would use to justify it. Put yourself in their shoes. What are their beliefs, values, assumptions, or goals? Why do they believe what they believe? What would be the most effective evidence for their position? What is the most convincing argument you could make from their standpoint? While you don\u2019t necessarily need to cite them for this exercise, you can draw on your research. Have you found articles that have different viewpoints than you? What evidence or justifications do they put forth? Use these to guide your reasoning. You want to make it convincing, compelling, and realistic. I shouldn't be able to tell that this isn't actually your position. 3. Justifications Now that you have three reasons to back your thesis, give a brief justification (1-3 sentences) that explains why a reasonable person would choose each of these reasons to argue this position. How does this reason help them to make a compelling argument? How does it advance their position? Why is this an effective reason for this argument? Please let me know if you have questions or concerns."}, "6502558": {"name": "Planting a Naysayer", "due_at": "2023-11-10T04:59:59Z", "description": "For this activity, you will be responding twice to a viewpoint you don't agree with in order to refute it in two different ways. In other words, you will produce two different paragraph-length refutations of that viewpoint. Feel free to use your 'other side' thesis, reasons, or justifications from the Considering Another Side activity as the naysayer you will plant into your text. Then concede what, if anything, you agree with in that thesis, reason, or justification, before refuting the claim with your own argument and evidence. Remember you can refute in many ways: you can argue with the claim, the reasons, or the justifications. You can provide counter-evidence. You can quibble with definitions, facts, methods, or interpretations. You can agree with some of the reasons and refute others. And so on. Be creative! If you can back your refutation with evidence from one of your research sources, even better! Example: If your 'other side' thesis was: \"I propose free pizza for all UMD students on Friday afternoons because college students are hungry, pizza is delicious, and this plan would build better relations between students and the university.\" ... then you want to plant that as a naysayer and refute some or all of it in TWO different ways. 1. Some might argue that UMD students should get free pizza on Fridays because college students are hungry, pizza is delicious, and this plan would build better relationships between students and the university. I agree that students are hungry and pizza is delicious\u2014who wouldn't? However, pizza is expensive and if the university provided it every week, it would quickly become so expensive that UMD would have to raise tuition costs or charge additional student fees to cover it. Therefore, this plan would ultimately strain relations between students and the university rather than improve them. 2. Others have proposed that UMD students should get free pizza on Fridays because college students are hungry, pizza is delicious, and this plan would build better relationships between students and the university. However, this is a top down policy that rests on faulty assumptions. Some students don't like pizza and others may even be allergic to its ingredients. Why should pizza lovers get free food every week and these equally deserving students get nothing? I argue that the more equitable way to improve student relations with the university is to give each student $15 a week instead so that they can choose what they want to eat. In this model, everyone is happy and student-administration relations will improve.

Successful academic writing and research depends upon the ability of a writer to summarize, analyze, synthesize, and respond to the ongoing conversation about a particular issue.\u00a0Summarizing involves listening in on the conversation that other academics are having about a research topic and demonstrating an understanding of the claims, evidence, and controversies surrounding the topic. The ability to write an effective summary might be the most important writing skill a college student can possess. You need to be able to summarize before you can be successful at most of the other kinds of writing that will be demanded of you in college.

Audience Your audience for this summary is other students at UMD, but should be academic in tone. You might think of your summary as if it might be posted on a course website to summarize the article for an absent classmate who wasn't able to do the reading. Writing the Summary This summary will demonstrate that you have closely read Guenther\u2019s blog post. Remember, you are summarizing, not analyzing or responding. You should report objectively (and, since you have just 300 words, concisely) Guenthers\u2019s argument, her support, and a sense of how she constructs that argument. Don\u2019t forget a specific, informative title!

Successful academic writing and research depends upon the ability of a writer to summarize, analyze, synthesize, and respond to the ongoing conversation about a particular issue.\u00a0Summarizing involves listening in on the conversation that other academics are having about a research topic and demonstrating an understanding of the claims, evidence, and controversies surrounding the topic. The ability to write an effective summary might be the most important writing skill a college student can possess. You need to be able to summarize before you can be successful at most of the other kinds of writing that will be demanded of you in college. Assignment Write a summary of \u201cThe Living Death of Solitary Confinement\u201d by Lisa Guenther. Your summary will be about 300 words long and should be double-spaced. Audience Your audience for this summary is other students at UMD, but should be academic in tone. You might think of your summary as if it might be posted on a course website to summarize the article for an absent classmate who wasn't able to do the reading. Writing the Summary This summary will demonstrate that you have closely read Guenther\u2019s blog post. Remember, you are summarizing, not analyzing or responding. You should report objectively (and, since you have just 300 words, concisely) Guenthers\u2019s argument, her support, and a sense of how she constructs that argument. Don\u2019t forget a specific, informative title!

Her goal is to dispel negative perceptions of feminists as \u201cmen haters\u201d and instead to offer a new, more positive explanation of this political position. Feminism, for hooks, is a \u201cmovement to end sexism, sexist exploitation, and oppression,\u201d and she notes that anyone can be a feminist if he or she works towards this end (viii).

Now you will discern how sources connect and speak to one another. The Conversation Map is a visual organizer that will help you (1) explore the main ideas your sources are discussing and (2) prepare to synthesize these sources in your Literature Review. You will explain the arguments that people are already making succinctly, clearly, and without adding your own opinion. You will identify the points of intersection , or places where some arguments overlap or come together and work with each other. You will also identify the points of divergence , or places where some arguments disagree or push and work against each other. In short, you will visually map the conversation . Skills: reading critically, identifying where authors converge and diverge, developing main ideas to focus on for Literature Review and Position Paper Number of sources: You will use 8-10 sources at this stage in your research; at least 6 should be scholarly. You will likely need some new sources as your research direction shifts. Open-Source Resources: (1) This brief tutorial models a slightly different format, but the gist is clearly explained: Link 1 (Links to an external site.) (2) This longer tutorial is more topic-specific, but is also useful: Link 2 (Links to an external site.) Step 1. Building the basic Conversation Map Create a grid and fill in by doing the following: At the top of your grid, write down the general topic or research question. Based on your research, consider which main ideas have emerged. Use the top row of the grid (see \u201c Main Idea 1 \u201d) to describe 4-5 main ideas, using a different column for each idea. Write MLA 8-10 citations ( see this guide for help (Links to an external site.) ) for the sources in the first cell of each row (the left-hand column). Note: to add more rows to your table: right click in the table and select Insert row above/below. For each source, consider which main ideas emerge and summarize them in the columns you\u2019ve developed (you'll replace the XXX a brief statement of how the article takes up that idea). If, in your sources, you find a new main idea (i.e. a main idea that doesn\u2019t fit into one of your \u201cMain Idea\u201d columns), create a new column for it. In the complete Conversation Map, you will have 8-10 sources and 4-5 \u201cMain Idea\u201d columns, with entries scattered throughout the chart. Note that not all main ideas occur in all sources. Some cells are going to be blank (see XXX ) . Step 2. Stepping Back to Consider (you won't turn anything in from this section; it's prep for Step 3) Now you have a basic Conversation Map. Your visual organizer should look a lot like the one above. Your next step is to recognize connections and identify gaps. Recognize the spaces where authors are connecting by talking through similar issues. Identify the gaps that represent unexplored areas or missing research. Consider any/all of the following questions. Recognize Connections: What do multiple sources say about your \u201cmain ideas\u201d? Do multiple sources corroborate or build on the same points? What do they each add that is unique? Do sources agree or disagree about main ideas? Mark these interesting points of contention; they will be important for developing arguments and counterarguments or zeroing in on conflicting plans of action. Do your sources refer to each other, directly or indirectly? Do they concede to, agree with, or refute each other? Identify Gaps: When you look at your filled out grid and see a row that only has one source talking about a main idea, what can you deduce from that? What if there is a source in a main idea column that none of the other sources talk about and it doesn't contribute to the main ideas the other sources contribute to? Do some sources feel irrelevant and need to be omitted? Do critical gaps in your research possibly represent previously unexplored areas or pressure points where you imagine you might intervene? Step 3. Reflection To organize your thoughts, use what you found in Step 2 to write a 200-300 word reflection on this process. Consider any/all of the following questions: What are the benefits of categorizing your research in these ways? What struggles did you come up against as you categorized your research? What did you observe about the available (or yet incomplete) literature when filling in this grid? What gaps or overlaps did you identify? What further research will you need? What argument(s) about the available research emerged through this assignment? Based on this grid, how do you imagine you\u2019ll organize your Literature Review? What 2-3 tasks are directly in front of you as you develop your Literature Review? How will this help you prepare for your Position Paper? ***Language here is drawn from the SUU Description: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Hu9fZtXQ-mso9hKU7h6KYw0LhpCwliHx1ckunKz3CJs/edit?usp=sharing"}, "6502555": {"name": "Literature Review", "due_at": "2023-11-03T03:59:59Z", "description": "Assignment: For this assignment, you will create a 3-4 page Literature Review. \u201cLiterature\u201d in this context is defined as credible writing about your topic, not literary writing (like a novel or poem). You will draw explicitly from 5-7 credible sources to paint a cohesive, critical, and well-organized picture of the research available about your issue. \u201cReview\u201d also has a somewhat specific meaning in this context. You will need to analyze the available research, present a clear argument about its scope, and, importantly, forecast your own potential intervention into the conversation. The Literature Review is a vital springboard for developing your own argument; this is where you move from asking questions that interest you and conducting research to finding a niche for public intervention. The Literature Review creates a foothold for you to respond to the available writing and research and make your own intervention. Skills: The Literature Review asks you to: continue to explore, research, and write about the issue you\u2019ve chosen to engage throughout the semester use the skills we\u2019ve reviewed previously, including research, summary, analysis, and inquiry. engage with stasis theory to consider ways to use your selected sources practice synthesizing research and nuanced arguments. learn how to discuss, categorize, compare, and contrast sources and engage with their rhetorical moves. Sources: The Literature Review first asks that you return to the sources you collected in the initial stages of your research. These sources represented a range of scholarly, popular, multimedia, and print texts (and some made it to your Inquiry and Annotated Bibliography). Many of these sources may continue to be useful in the Literature Review; however, as your research direction evolves, you will very likely need to collect new sources as well. You will use old and new research methods to select sources and identify various intersecting and conflicting positions. Drawing from that pool of new and existing research, as well as your analysis, you will select 5-7 (5 must be scholarly) sources to explore in your Literature Review (and ultimately to help you develop your Position Paper). Synthesis to Argument: In writing your Literature Review, you will do the important work of synthesis, which means putting your selected sources and authors in conversation with each other. To achieve this kind of source synthesis, you will practice integration strategies, as well as study potential systems of organization that will help you categorize your sources and articulate their arguments, differences, similarities, strengths, and weaknesses. The Literature Review won\u2019t, however, be simply a list of sources or even conversant source annotations. You will ultimately develop a thesis (argument) for your Literature Review. This thesis won\u2019t yet take a position on your topic; rather, you will identify the research clusters you\u2019ve developed and critically consider how scholarship on your topic converges and/or diverges, mining for critical gaps or discrepancies in the research where you might potentially intervene. Audience: Literature Review is a genre that helps scholars\u2014and public intellectuals, medical professionals, politicians, reporters, lawyers, and researchers across disciplines\u2014assess the scope of available research and carve out space in critical discourse. In short, conducting a literature review can help you get a sense of the \u201cconversation\u201d surrounding a topic. Knowing who\u2019s saying what about your topic is an integral step to inserting your own ideas. While literature reviews sometimes appear as standalone projects, they are often integrated into larger peer-reviewed publications. To move toward this kind of writing, you should imagine writing for a primary audience of undergraduate researchers within your field. This audience wants to understand the state of play--and where you will fit into the discourse. Your audience may have these kinds of questions: What is the state of the conversation? Who is talking to whom and how? What aren't people saying? Interestingly, you might also imagine yourself as a secondary audience. This project is designed to help you integrate the sources, stakeholder positions, and systems of organization that will be directly useful in your Position Paper. So you should think about practical ways to use this review of relevant literature to deepen your understanding of your topic and articulate ways you, as an emerging scholar, may intervene.

Purpose : You have been working toward this paper all semester, gathering research and considering (and re-considering) your position as well as others. Your work in this essay is to take a position within the debate that you\u2019ve explored in your inquiry. The goal is to build on what you\u2019ve learned and what you\u2019ve argued to take a position within the conversation and make a new claim within your issue. This argumentative essay will be the place where you can share the fruits of your research and argue for the ideas you have developed through your writing and research process. Audience : You will identify an audience for this project. When you do, remember the genre of the essay: you are making an academic argument. However, this genre should not be seen as limiting. Academics are not the only people who read academic arguments, and academic arguments are often found in widely read publications. Thus, you should think of your audience as an interested group who expects to encounter a thoughtful, informed, and persuasive essay. Writing the Position Paper Most of you will use rhetorical strategies that take up concerns of cause, consequence, and proposals for new action. Thus, you might work in this final paper to pinpoint the cause and the consequences of the problem you have been exploring and then propose a solution. Such a focus on proposals and solutions is indeed welcome. We can all identify problems; the challenge is to create solutions. For this project, you are required to have a bibliography of at least fifteen sources. At least 10 of these sources need to be academic (peer reviewed books or articles; for our purposes, government and scholarly reports will also satisfy this requirement); the others might include blogs, interviews, magazine or newspaper articles, YouTube videos, or graphs from government or think tank websites. All sources must be reputable, credible, and useful for your case. Of course, you should draw on previous assignments (Annotated Bibliography, Inquiry, Conversation Map, Literature Review, etc.) You\u2019ll also need to conduct more research. A great part of your success in this assignment will be determined by how well you employ your research. One of the trickiest parts of a long argument is organization. You need to give an overview, stake your claim, offer evidence, refute evidence\u2014how will you put it all together? There are two rhetorical tools to help you here. The first is the stasis grid. You can use the hierarchy of the stases, the way that an issue in one stasis depends on or interacts with an issue in another stasis, to help shape the paper. If you are making an argument about action, for example, you might introduce your thesis, but then bring in issues from fact/definition to establish background, issues from cause/effect to show exigence, issues from value to further develop a sense of importance and urgency, and then come to more extensive support for your claim about action. The \u201cparts of a full argument\u201d lecture/slides (forthcoming) offers guidelines about how to begin, give context, and how provide a road map for the paper. Reflective Writing for Position Paper (for final draft only) Please respond to the following prompts in about 300 words: What are the strengths of this essay? What are the weaknesses? How did you take into account my feedback on your earlier assignments? How did the writing processes you moved through in Rhetorical Analysis and Inquiry affect the way you wrote the Position Paper? Think back over the class activities for this unit, what learning experiences helped you as you drafted and revised this essay? Be specific. Style in Focus: How do you maintain the known-new contract through the argument?\u00a0 What did you do to make sure that your audience had information when they needed it?"}, "6502559": {"name": "Position Paper", "due_at": "2023-11-22T04:59:59Z", "description": "The Assignment : You will write an 8-10 page position paper plus a Works Cited page featuring at least fifteen sources. Purpose : You have been working toward this paper all semester, gathering research and considering (and re-considering) your position as well as others. Your work in this essay is to take a position within the debate that you\u2019ve explored in your inquiry. The goal is to build on what you\u2019ve learned and what you\u2019ve argued to take a position within the conversation and make a new claim within your issue. This argumentative essay will be the place where you can share the fruits of your research and argue for the ideas you have developed through your writing and research process. Audience : You will identify an audience for this project. When you do, remember the genre of the essay: you are making an academic argument. However, this genre should not be seen as limiting. Academics are not the only people who read academic arguments, and academic arguments are often found in widely read publications. Thus, you should think of your audience as an interested group who expects to encounter a thoughtful, informed, and persuasive essay. Writing the Position Paper Most of you will use rhetorical strategies that take up concerns of cause, consequence, and proposals for new action. Thus, you might work in this final paper to pinpoint the cause and the consequences of the problem you have been exploring and then propose a solution. Such a focus on proposals and solutions is indeed welcome. We can all identify problems; the challenge is to create solutions. For this project, you are required to have a bibliography of at least fifteen sources. At least 10 of these sources need to be academic (peer reviewed books or articles; for our purposes, government and scholarly reports will also satisfy this requirement); the others might include blogs, interviews, magazine or newspaper articles, YouTube videos, or graphs from government or think tank websites. All sources must be reputable, credible, and useful for your case. Of course, you should draw on previous assignments (Annotated Bibliography, Inquiry, Conversation Map, Literature Review, etc.) You\u2019ll also need to conduct more research. A great part of your success in this assignment will be determined by how well you employ your research. One of the trickiest parts of a long argument is organization. You need to give an overview, stake your claim, offer evidence, refute evidence\u2014how will you put it all together? There are two rhetorical tools to help you here. The first is the stasis grid. You can use the hierarchy of the stases, the way that an issue in one stasis depends on or interacts with an issue in another stasis, to help shape the paper. If you are making an argument about action, for example, you might introduce your thesis, but then bring in issues from fact/definition to establish background, issues from cause/effect to show exigence, issues from value to further develop a sense of importance and urgency, and then come to more extensive support for your claim about action.

Purpose : The fifth major assignment of the semester, the Infographic and Reflective Memo, asks you to consider how you might revise your position paper to engage a public, non-academic audience about the issue you have engaged with throughout the semester. The goal is to think about how a specific public audience differs from a strictly academic one. Your previous assignments should provide the foundation for this project, but the purpose is for you to think about reframing your argument for a different audience in a different medium. Audience : While of course the digital environment would potentially allow anyone to view it, your goal is to shape your infographic\u2019s appeals to a specific audience (i.e., not \u201cthe general public\u201d) by using language, evidence, and visuals that would be of interest to them. Remember: your writing is public, so be mindful of how you represent yourself. Infographic Component Use Canva (Links to an external site.) to design an infographic that presents the relevance of your research to your intended audience. You should be attentive to and make use of the affordances of the medium. Affordances are options available to you in different media that enable you to craft, shape, and present your message. A written essay has different affordances than a website or video. Thus you will want to be sure you are aware and take advantage of the specific affordances that infographics allow . You will want to consider the following questions in thinking about how you will create your infographic: How do my choices of font, color, images, graphics, and arrangement reflect the message and overarching project of the infographic? How can I purposefully and thoughtfully make use of these features so that they add depth to my message and reach my audience? You want to think, first and foremost, about audience . What do you need to revise to make your argument more understandable or relatable to this online audience? What is the rhetorical situation? How can you appeal to common beliefs, assumptions, or values with your audience? What level of detail is appropriate to this audience in this medium? You want to think about presentation and formatting . You have likely relied on the full parts of an argument to structure your position paper. You will want to retain each of those parts, but because we are working on an infographic rather than a traditional paper, you will likely arrange the argument differently and more concisely. This may be as simple as breaking up blocks of text with \u201cpull\u201d quotations, images, or other affordances of the medium. Your infographic should create a clear visual narrative that is intuitive for readers to navigate . The translations you make must be substantive and effective , but you need not make an entirely new argument . Rather, you are making a similar argument meant to appeal to a different audience. In moving your argument from a paper to an infographic, you might rethink major aspects of the essay such as appeals, arrangement, introductions and conclusions, integration of research and so on. These changes should be in the service of demonstrating that you know how to respond to a different rhetorical situation. Reflection Component As you work on your infographic, you will compose a reflective memo ( 1.5-2 pages double-spaced ). The expectation here is that you discuss the specific changes you\u2019ve made, and, more importantly , explain the rationale for your translation and revision . In your reflective memo, you might discuss how you appealed to your online audience, how you thought through issues related to cohesiveness and purpose, how you created a new organizational strategy that allowed for greater sense of purpose and cohesion, and/or how you used affordances purposefully to take advantage of the medium. Detailed discussions in your memo are vital because they highlight the thinking and decision-making that directed your revisions . Here is where I gain a sense that you are making conscious, careful, and rhetorically effective decisions. Furthermore, the idea behind the reflective memo is that you offer me a guide to reading your translation.
