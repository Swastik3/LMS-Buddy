            "description": "Informative Outline (30 points) You will submit an outline for the Informative Presentation. You should organize your outline using a nested structure. You may consider following an organizational structure, as explained in your textbook (i.e., chronological/temporal, spatial/geographical, temporal, comparative advantage). Please be sure that your outline also includes the components of an introduction , body , and conclusion; as well as transitions, internal previews , and signposts . This outline will organize your entire presentation in full sentences. For more information, see Chapter 6: Presentation Preparation. Further Guidelines: Research: Your outline must include at least three (3) sources. These sources must support and reinforce the main ideas and claims made throughout the outline. They must come from credible sources, such as expert interviews, academic journals, and newspapers. All references to external sources must be attributed using complete and accurate in-text citations and be properly formatted at the end of the outline. For more information on citation resources see https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/research_and_citation/resources.html Introduction: Your introduction should gain the audience's attention, provide a clear thesis statement, establish practicality, and preview the main points of your presentation. The attention grabber must hook the audience and draw them into the presentation. The purpose/central idea/thesis statement should narrow the topic, and it should not be persuasive. For more information, see Chapter 6: Presentation Preparation and Chapter 8: Informative Presentations. Body: The body of your speech should have a structure that makes sense for the presentation (e.g., chronological, spatial, topical). It should be arranged logically to present concepts. It should have artfully-constructed transitions between ideas. Don't just say, \"second...\" but provide a segue from one point to another. There should be enough material in the body to make the presentation thorough, but not so much that it moves outside the time frame of a 3-4 minute presentation. For more information, see Chapter 6: Presentation Preparation. Conclusion: Your conclusion should restate the goal, review the main points, and complete the circular narrative. Explanatory strategies: The presentation outline should also note places where the speaker will use stories, analogies, examples, evidence, and other techniques to liven-up and better engage the audience For more information, see Chapter 8: Informative Presentations. Learning Outcome Demonstrate competency in planning, preparing, and presenting effective oral presentations."
